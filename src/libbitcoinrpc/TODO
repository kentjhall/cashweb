TODO
====

To be done before the next release (0.3.0):

1. Never enough unit tests! (The tests of settxfee are rather primitive.)
2. Improve and expand documentation.


Do something about the following:

3. SSL support has been dropped in Core 0.12.0
4. Random cookie support has been introduced in Core 0.12.0
